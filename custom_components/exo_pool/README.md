# Exo Pool ‚Äì Home Assistant Integration

A custom integration to connect your Zodiac iAqualink **Exo** pool system to Home Assistant, providing full control and monitoring of your pool‚Äôs features.

## üÜï What‚Äôs New
- **23 Sep 2025** - Added experimental climate entity for systems with the heat pump enabled.
- **15 Sep 2025** ‚Äì Added option to adjust API refresh rate to avoid *‚ÄúToo Many Requests‚Äù* errors.
- **3 Sep 2025** ‚Äì Added binary_sensors for each schedule plus actions to change schedules.

---

## Installation (via HACS)

1. In Home Assistant, go to **HACS ‚Üí Integrations**.
2. Search for **Exo Pool** and click **Install**.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration**, search for **Exo Pool**, and follow the prompts.

## Features

- **Automatic Authentication** ‚Äì Secure login to the iAqualink API using your email and password.
- **System Selection** ‚Äì Pick your Exo system from multiple pools/devices (filtered to `device_type: "exo"`).
- **Sensors** ‚Äì Temperature, pH, ORP, ORP Boost Time Remaining, Pump RPM, Error Code, Wi-Fi RSSI, Schedules.
- **Binary Sensors** ‚Äì Filter Pump running, Chlorinator running, Error State, Authentication Status, Connected, and one per schedule.
- **Switches** ‚Äì ORP Boost, Power State, Production, Aux 1, Aux 2, SWC Low.
- **Numbers** ‚Äì pH Set Point and ORP Set Point (when supported).
- **Services** ‚Äì Control and modify schedules (see below).
- **Diagnostics & Dynamic Device Info** ‚Äì View hardware configuration and live status; serial number and software version update periodically.
- **Configurable Refresh Rate** ‚Äì Default 30 s; increase if you see *Too Many Requests* errors (60 s recommended).

## Schedule Services

Each Exo schedule is exposed as a binary sensor:

- **State**: `on` when active.
- **Attributes**: `schedule`, `enabled`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `type` (`vsp` | `swc` | `aux` | other), and `rpm` (VSP only).
- **Icons**: VSP ‚Üí pump/pump-off, SWC ‚Üí water-plus/water-off, AUX ‚Üí toggle, calendar fallback.

### `exo_pool.set_schedule`
Create or update a schedule‚Äôs time range and optional VSP RPM.

```yaml
service: exo_pool.set_schedule
target:
  entity_id: binary_sensor.schedule_filter_pump_2
data:
  start: "11:00"
  end: "23:00"
  rpm: 2000
```

You can also target the device and specify `schedule: sch6` instead of the entity.

### `exo_pool.disable_schedule`
Disable a schedule by setting start and end to `00:00`.

```yaml
service: exo_pool.disable_schedule
target:
  entity_id: binary_sensor.schedule_salt_water_chlorinator_2
```

## Device Actions (Automations)

When creating an automation:
**Device ‚Üí your Exo Pool device ‚Üí Actions**: *Set schedule* or *Disable schedule*.
These map directly to the services above.

## History

The core iAqualink integration never supported Exo devices (European Zodiac-branded chlorinators). See the long-running discussion: [flz/iaqualink-py#16](https://github.com/flz/iaqualink-py/discussions/16).
After early Node-RED flows and REST template hacks, this dedicated integration was built to provide full native support.

---

## Limitations

- Restricted to **Exo** devices only; use the core iAqualink integration for other hardware.
- Commands (set points, Aux switches, etc.) can be slightly laggy; switches are optimistic with ~10 s refresh.
- Schedule keys, names and endpoints are determined by the device; disabling a schedule is modelled as `00:00‚Äì00:00`.
- RPM is only relevant to VSP schedules.

## Compatibility

Confirmed working with:
- **Exo IQ LS** (dual-link ORP & pH, Zodiac VSP pump).

Have success with other models? Please share!
